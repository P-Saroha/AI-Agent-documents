Machine Learning: Fundamentals and Applications

What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Unlike traditional programming where rules are explicitly coded, ML algorithms build models based on sample data, known as training data, to make predictions or decisions.

Core Concepts

1. Features and Labels
- Features: Input variables used to make predictions
- Labels: Output variables that we're trying to predict
- Feature Engineering: The process of selecting and transforming variables

2. Training and Testing
The dataset is typically split into:
- Training Set (70-80%): Used to train the model
- Validation Set (10-15%): Used to tune parameters
- Test Set (10-15%): Used to evaluate final performance

3. Overfitting and Underfitting
- Overfitting: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Underfitting: Model is too simple to capture patterns
- The goal is to find the right balance

Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning
The algorithm learns from labeled examples. Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values
- Logistic Regression: Binary classification
- Decision Trees: Tree-like model of decisions
- Random Forests: Ensemble of decision trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finds optimal boundary
- Neural Networks: Inspired by biological neurons

Unsupervised Learning
The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data:
- K-Means Clustering: Groups similar data points
- Hierarchical Clustering: Creates cluster hierarchy
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction
- Anomaly Detection: Identifies unusual patterns

Reinforcement Learning
The algorithm learns through interaction with environment:
- Q-Learning: Learn value of actions in states
- Deep Q-Networks: Combines Q-learning with deep learning
- Policy Gradient Methods: Directly optimize policy
- Applications: Game playing, robotics, autonomous systems

Model Evaluation Metrics

For Classification:
- Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions
- Precision: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- Recall: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- ROC-AUC: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve

For Regression:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average absolute difference
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average squared difference
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE
- R-squared: Proportion of variance explained
